About this project:

I want to port midish to esp32, because it is a really good programm to do headless midi.
Compile it with ardunio ide / Esp32 board.
It already makes it shell available over the serial monitor and accepts commands! 

Next steps:
- support midi in/out.
- allow to map commands to the GPIO, e.g. have one pin to start playback and an other to stop.
- add a small 7-Seg LED for showing the current track/beat is
- make shell available over wlan
...

Midish is an open-source MIDI sequencer/filter for Unix-like operating
systems. Implemented as a simple command-line interpreter, it's intended to
be lightweight, fast and reliable for real-time performance.

Important features:
	- multiple MIDI devices handling
	- synchronization to external audio/MIDI hardware/software
	- real-time MIDI filtering/routing (controller 
	  mapping, keyboard splitting, ...)
	- track recording, metronome
	- basic track editing (insert, copy, delete, ...)
	- progressive track quantisation
	- import and export of standard MIDI files
	- tempo and time-signature changes
	- system exclusive messages handling
	- unlimited undo

Contents:
	- midish - the sequencer/filter
	- smfplay, smfrec - MIDI file player and recorder
